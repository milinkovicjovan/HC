                HeartCount allows us to determine how our people are feeling and
                build stronger bonds between teammates. The platform itself
                supports employers who care for their teams, completely aligning
                with the fact that the most valuable asset of any organization
                is their employees. As a professional who'd just started
                building a career in HR, HeartCount personally helped me set up
                short term goals for myself and learn how to design proposals
                concerning EX to upper management.
